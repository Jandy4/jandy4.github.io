# Nandre

My passion and hobyy  is designing and writing computer programs. I also like to play CTFs and boxes from sites like [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/) and [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). My co-hobby is composing music, for a multitude of genres, including: film, game, synthwave. 

I made this site to share some of my thoughts and projects that I hope people can learn from. The majority of my projects are open-source. You can check them on [my Github](https://github.com/nan-dre)

# Languages I know:

Romanian, Python, English, C++, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS

# Software I made
* [OLDI](https://github.com/nan-dre/OLDI) - GUI interface for a book library database.
* [RFG](https://github.com/nan-dre/Graphical-Roy-Floyd-Algorithm) - a visual representation of Roy-Floyd's Algorigthm, implemented in C++ and SFML.
## Scripts
* [Excel workbooks merge script](https://github.com/nan-dre/Excel-workbooks-merge-script) - a python script that takes excel files from a folder and merges them into a single excel file.
* [Markdown anchors from titles](https://github.com/nan-dre/anchor-tags-from-title) - c script that converts a list of titles to coresponding markdown anchor tags.
