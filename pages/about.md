# Nandre

My passion and hobyy  is designing and writing computer programs. I also like to play CTFs and boxes from sites like [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/) and [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). My co-hobby is composing music, for a multitude of genres, including: film, game, synthwave. 

I made this site to share some of my thoughts and projects that I hope people can learn from. The majority of my projects are open-source. You can check them on [my Github](https://github.com/nan-dre)

# Languages I know:

Romanian, Python, English, C++, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS
